Mini Android test of the **CurlView** component implementation from the **PageCurl** library developed by **Oleksandr Balan** https://github.com/oleksandrbalan/pagecurl.

Developed in Kotlin with **Jetpack Compose**, this project tests the integration of the **PageCurl** library into an Android app, to avoid direct manipulation of OpenGL via an **AndroidView**.

## üöÄ Project Overview

**Context**:  
The goal is to test the integration of the **PageCurl** library developed by **Oleksandr Balan**. This library allows the creation of page-turning animations in an Android app while being **Compose-friendly**, which eliminates the need to manipulate OpenGL directly.

**Mission**:  
- Test the basic implementation of **CurlView**.
- Explore and use the new features of version 1.5.1 of the library.
- Create a functional demo applied to the first 12 pages of a manga to evaluate performance, especially with larger **.jpg** images.
- The goal is not to reinvent the wheel but to test and validate the implementation of an existing library.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Main Features

- **Basic CurlView Implementation**: Test if the page-turning animation works correctly with a simple setup.
- **Exploring New Features of Version 1.5.1**: Use the new options offered by the library to enhance the page-turning effect.
- **Functional Demo**: Apply the library to a manga to test fluidity and performance with larger **.jpg** images.
- **Performance Testing**: Evaluate the impact of the library on performance with large images and test the smoothness of the animation.
